This project includes whether the patient will get a stroke or not based on the features given in the dataset. The project includes pre-processing and model fitting in Python. Following that is a comparison between 9 different models and evaluation of each of them using kfold cross validation. Moreover it includes fine-tuning of the best selected models along with the plotting of learning curve to see accuracy score against training size since itâ€™s a good way to see the overfitting effect. Ended with the implementation of VotingClassifier to combine the best selected model classifiers predictions.
